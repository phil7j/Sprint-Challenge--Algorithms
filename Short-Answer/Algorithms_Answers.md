#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) The running time for this function is logarithmic time, O(log n). Because the input and the and number of operations are not the same.

b) The running time is O(n^2). It works for smaller inputs, but it doesn't scale with larger inputs. It has nested loops both using the input.

c) Runtime is exponential O(c^n). As the input will increase, the runtime will grow at a really fast rate. This is because it has to call itself over and over as it counts down to zero.
